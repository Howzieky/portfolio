		<p>Project 1 - Gravity Game</p>
		<br>
		<p>I made this game while taking a high school physics class. I made it with the purpose of learning programming and math. I'd say it's worked out pretty well so far! It's a planet simulator. Just click and drag, try playing with gravity!</p>

		<p>Project 2 - Vision Precision</p>
		<br>
		<p>Another game I made so that I could learn how to code. You can control the rgb values of the inner circle. The goal is to make the color of the inner circle identical to the outer square, in the smallest time possible.</p>
