			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm a 20 year old dude, been programming since I was around 11, actually got good when I was 15/16. Made a website and learned a couple different languages. Programming is fun! <span class="strikethrough">Hurts to not be able to use CSS yet, though.</span></p>

				<h3>Project 1 - Gravity Game</h3>
				<p>I made this game while taking a high school physics class. I made it with the purpose of learning programming and math. I'd say it's worked out pretty well so far! It's a planet simulator. Just click and drag, try playing with gravity!</p>

				<h3>Project 2 - Vision Precision</h3>
				<p>Another game I made so that I could learn how to code. You can control the rgb values of the inner circle. The goal is to make the color of the inner circle identical to the outer square in the smallest time possible.</p>

				<h3>Project 3 - Pool Table Physics Simulator</h3>
				<p>I wanted to make a pool table game with powerups and other weird quirks, but I moved on to the next project before doing anything more than getting the simulator working. Still pretty fun to play with, though.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="textContainer">
			<p>I've been programming since I was 11, but I've only been good at it since I was 15 or so. I made a website with some HTML5 games in order to learn how to program, and when I was 19, I got my first programming job with Isos Technology. I started there in March 2019, making and updating web plugins, writing Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently on hiatus so that I can focus on my schooling.</p>
